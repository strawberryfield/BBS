{body}{p}In 1989 I found myself making a small newspaper with a program of pagination 
 called Ventura Publisher. At the time, similar jobs were being done with the 
 typewriter and someone also taught me to justify the packet text (i.e. aligned 
 left and right) by first writing on a squared sheet. The sheet with three 
 proportional columns justified as a package and many other small goodies did 
 not seem certain came out of a needle printer (which worked for interminable 
 time making a deafening noise). The captivating graphic aspect he got me the 
 commission of various booklets and leaflets and I also had the possibility to 
 print with a laser printer. The laser wasn't more quick since it took a 
 quarter of an hour before the page to come out (much to the dismay of the 
 owner who was told the printer was capable of 11 pages per minute), but the 
 resolution, although it cannot go beyond 150 dpi for memory problems, it 
 really gave a show.{/p} 
 
{p}At the bottom of these publications appeared the trademark The Strawberry 
 Field or, in some cases, the most autarchic and mocking Antica Stramberia 
 delle Fragole.{/p} 
 
{p}Also in that year I bought a modem with which to connect to some BBS of the 
 FidoNet network. A sysop (the owner of the BBS) gave me the opportunity to 
 install a point for which I used the same nickname "The Strawberry Field." For 
 those unfamiliar with it, the Fidonet network was a amateur network in which 
 the various nodes (BBS) called each other in the night hours (due the problem 
 of telephone costs) with analog modems and exchanged the messages that users 
 of single nodes left on the BBS; there were two types of mail: echomail 
 similar to a newsgroup and the matrix where the messages went "privately" from 
 one user to another as the internet mail. One "point" was that a personal BBS 
 able to connect only to the node that granted this possibility and it allowed 
 you to read your mail offline, otherwise you would have to read it standing 
 connected as you do today with webmail services.{/p} 
 
{p}But my main interest was in photography, I had started following my father's 
 teachings with the instamatic Kodak he had given when I was 8 years old. The 
 photos I took have always been very popular I remember that the incredulous 
 teacher spread the whole school to show the photos that I had taken during the 
 school trip; incidentally those same photos were a lot criticized by my 
 father... Later I started using his reflex cameras (strictly Pentax) and some 
 services were also commissioned (fashion shows); while instead I have always 
 categorically refused to do photo shoots for weddings. In fact, at weddings I 
 always went armed with a photo camera, but I wanted to feel free to photograph 
 what I wanted; then maybe someone put a my photo in the frame and not that of 
 the official photographer.{/p} 
 
{p}For a few years the three things traveled separately: the graphic works, the 
 telematic links in plain text and photographs on films. Then CD players 
 arrived and by scanning a photo from a service you could have a PhotoCD with 
 your own images to work with the computer where the photos could be combined 
 with the graphics. Also one fine day I happened to hands a program called 
 Netscape Navigator: thanks to this system you could create a "BBS" with 
 graphics and photos (what we today we call "website"). I had finally found the 
 link between the two souls of The Strawberry Field: the "artistic" part and 
 that of communication.{/p} 
 
{p}More recently my wife insisted that I buy a video camera for to take back our 
 son so that we could remember some amusing moments. This it was already 
 digital and the relative filming immediately became part of it an integral 
 part of The Strawberry Field productions exploiting the possible synergies as 
 can be seen from the tutorial on my site 
 (https://strawberryfield.altervista.org).{/p} 
 
{p}Today the brand The Strawberry Field gathers all the productions photographic, 
 video and graphics like this BBS.{/p} {/body}
