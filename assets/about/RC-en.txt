{p}I am 54 years old, I was born in Rimini (Italy), I live in Cesena with my wife 
 and our two sons.{/p} 
 
{p}I had my first camera when I was 8 and since then I have never stopped to take 
 photographs. I only regret not having time to work a bit in darkroom. (digital 
 printing does not give the same wonderful sensations).{/p} 
 
{p}Years ago I was convinced to buy a digital video camera and then I have 
 started trying to create interactive DVDs inspired by those of Walt Disney 
 watched by my childs. Indeed, since they are the main viewers of my DVDs they 
 must have been exactly the same.{/p} 
 
{p}I've been interested in programming since 1981 when they gave me one Texas 
 TI-58 calculator. Then I moved on to the glorious Commodore 64 and finally I 
 arrived at the PC, first with the dos, then OS / 2, linux (an old slackware 
 attached to a magazine) and, at the end, Windows (first NT then 2000).{/p} 
 
{p}Today I use Windows 10, Raspbian and Android as well as having fun with 
 microcontrollers such as Arduino and ESP8266.{/p} 
 
{p}On the way I met the university's VAX-VMS, an IBM-36 and an AS-400. For work I 
 have known SCO, AIX on RS-6000 and the whole range of Windows servers from NT4 
 onwards. I've always wanted a Mac, but the environments in which I have 
 operated were always turned elsewhere: once from a customer I got my hands on 
 the keyboard of an iMac and not knowing how to configure it I wrote "vi"...{/p} 
 
{p}I work for a software house where I coordinate the software development team.{/p} 
 
{p}In the past (1980s) I collaborated with the italian magazines MCmicrocomputer 
 and Nuova Elettronica. Furthermore RadioRAI (the italian public broadcasting 
 service) has broadcast some of my programs for the Commodore64 (yes, they 
 broadcast the audio cassette with the program recorded: in those days they 
 also did these things){/p} 
 
{p}More recent (early 2008) is the publication of the tutorial on DVDs on the 
 magazine Computer Programming{/p} 
 
{p}For some years I have been part of the development team of the open source 
 railway simulator OpenRails (http://openrails.org).{/p}
