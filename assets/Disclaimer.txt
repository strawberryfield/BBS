{CLS forecolor="Blue" backcolor="White"/} The Strawberry Field BBS - System Rules and Disclaimer:          
 ======================================================           

 Introduction:
 ------------
 
 I, Roberto Ceccarelli,  owner and system operator (henceforth referred to as
 the SysOp)  of   The Strawberry Field  Bulletin  Board  System   (henceforth 
 referred  to as the BBS)  hereby exercise my right  to enforce and apply the 
 rules and regulations  outlined in the paragraphs that follow  as I see fit.
 By continuing  to make use of  this service,  you  (the user)  indicate your
 acceptance of this agreement  and all rules and regulations laid down by the 
 SysOp. You further acknowledge that you have read and understood these rules 
 and agree to be bound by their terms and conditions.
 If you do not agree with these terms you must log off the system immediately.
 
 Rules of this BBS:
 -----------------
 
 All  equipment  utilised  to offer  this service  has been  supplied by  the 
 SysOp's  own financial and technical resources.  It therefore stands to good 
 reason that the rules laid down  are simply  for the SysOp's own protection.
 
 No fees are charged  for the use  of this BBS.   Under no circumstances will
 users  under  the  age  of  18 years be permitted on this BBS.  This BBS has 
 been established  purely for the experiential benefit of  the SysOp  and may
 cease to exist or be modified  in any way  and  at any time  at  the SysOp's  
 discretion  although all reasonable efforts will be made to keep this system
 online for as long as this planet continues to rotate.
                           
 The Strawberry Field BBS  is an OPEN SYSTEM.  Any users, regardless of race,
 colour,  creed,  religion  or sexual persuasion  ABOVE  the age of  18 years 
 are therefore welcome to use this system when and if they please.  The SysOp 
 does,  however,  reserve the exclusive right to  lock out  or barr  any user  
 whom he deems  unwelcome or undesirable,  based solely on his  understanding 
 and  judgement of  good manners and protocol  that should be applied  to any 
 service  of this kind,  and  on any  blatant ignorance  of  these rules  and 
 regulations by that user.
 
 Various  security levels  and  flags have been created in an effort to grade 
 and group  all users  of this BBS.  All new users  (like you)  are initially
 allocated a  Security Level of 1.  Only by following  the instructions  laid
 down  (such as filling in the New User Questionnaire and reading this System
 Rules and Disclaimer  text file)  will any  user's security level  increase,
 thereby gaining access to  otherwise prohibited areas (such as certain file-
 or  message  areas,  doors,  etc.),  functions  or  services  of  this  BBS.
 The decision on  any user's security level  and its associated privileges is
 made, as unbiased as possible, exclusively by the SysOp.
 
 Disclaimer:
 ----------
 
 The SysOp does  not  warrant,   nor can guarantee, that  the   files or data 
 stored in  The Strawberry Field BBS are accurate or suitable for a  specific 
 purpose or intention.   
 Under no circumstances will the SysOp, or any other persons associated  with
 this BBS,living or dead,be liable to you or any other parties for any damage, 
 physical, psychological or otherwise, lost profits, loss of data or finance,  
 either direct or consequential arising out of the use,  or inability to use, 
 any information or software that has been obtained from the HMVH Corporation 
 BBS through any means.
 
                                        
 In Conclusion:                        
 -------------

 The aforementioned rules and regulations can, as the need arises and without 
 prior notification, be modified or amended by the SysOp. Notification of any
 modifications shall be made by means of  a bulletin available for reading by
 all users.  Should any user not agree to, or abide by,  these, or any future
 modifications to the rules and regulations clearly stated herein,  the SysOp
 may,  at his sole discretion,  terminate that user's membership of this BBS.
